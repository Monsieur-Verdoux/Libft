# Libft

This library was my first project of Hive Helsinki curriculum. It includes many functions that replicate existing string and memory manipulation C libraries functions, as well as those related to linked lists. 
Later on, these more complex features were added:
- custom implementation of printf
- get_next_line which reads the file on file descriptor one line at a time
- vector implemetation based on this helpful tutorial - https://github.com/juliuskoskela/c-vec
